## Outline
### User/Audience Considerations
**Intended User/Audience:** Nonprofit Development Leaders; Foundation Leaders


**User Story**
* *As a reader, I want* **(an easy way to understand the severity of the issue)** *so that I can* **(persuade key stakeholders to make meaningful change quickly)**
* *I can do this by* **(emphasizing the severity and providing actionable solutions as a follow-up to the problem)**

**What are some ways this project can visualize elements of the user story?**
* Illustrate gaps and trends to show the severity and historical implications of the problem
* Guide the reader to a call to action that fits their specific circumstance


### Story Outline
**Summary/Thesis:** A significant way in which systemic racism manifests in the nonprofit sector is in the exclusion and “othering” of Black fundraisers and Black led organizations (BLOs) in the fundraising process. This barrier to resources makes it much harder for BLOs to do the necessary work to protect communities that are facing the symptoms of systemic racism themselves, and thus it is the responsibility of the significantly white Development and Foundation sector to understand, address, and resolve this issue.

 1. Overview of nonprofit sector and the role of contributed income
    * a.	Size of sector (# of registered nonprofits in US) in 2016 
    * b.	Total nonprofit Contributed income for 2016 (396.52 billion)<sup>1</sup>
    * c.	Total giving to nonprofits in 2019 ($449.64 billion)<sup>2</sup>
    
    
 2. Lack of funding: not a new issue, but publicly accessible data is hard to find. Echoing Green applicant data provides the largest, most recent, publicly available dataset<sup>3</sup>
    * a.	DATA VIZ (1): 2 Line charts, showing year over year
    * b.	Total Raised by Race/Ethnicity
    * c.	Total % of Applicants by Race/Ethnicity
    
    
 3. Black Fundraisers receive less than their white counterparts, despite being a significantly larger proportion of the applicant pool
    * a.	DATA VIZ (2): Data Viz Project #2: [Nonprofit Fundraising Dollars Awarded by Race/Ethnicity](FundraisingData.md)
    
    
 4. Not just individuals: Ethnic Minority Serving organizations (no Black delineation in data) receive less too
    * a.	DATA VIZ (3): PROGRAM AREA: Ethnic Minority Serving Organizations
    * b.	Significant proportion of Black population under poverty line<sup>4</sup>  
      * i.	Extend above viz to add in Economically Disadvantaged program area: DATA VIZ (4)
      
 5. Recent Increase in Awareness
    * a. Accessible data 
    * b. Increase in reports<sup>5</sup>
    * CCF 10 principles<sup>6</sup>
    
 6. Call to Action
 * a. Foundation Leaders: [Trust Based Philanthropy Project](https://trustbasedphilanthropy.org/)<sup>7</sup>
 * b. Nonprofit Development Leaders: [Community Centric Fundraising](https://communitycentricfundraising.org/)<sup>8</sup>

## The Data
 1. Echoing Green Data Set
    * The main data set I will be using for the above sketched visualizations is the collection of data on Echoing Green's Fellowship Program applicants. This is one of the largest collections of data on social enterprise applicants (download data set [here](Echoing-Green-SSE2-2020-Dataset.xlsx)). The visualizations from this data set will serve as the core/achoring visualizations for outline points 2-4.

 2. Various Reports (see Footnote 5 in Outline Reference section)
    * Due to the inaccessibility of large data sets on these issues (the few that exist other than Echoing Green are all behind paywalls), I will also be using visualizations found in the many reports written by institutions who have accessed and analyzed this paywall-blocked data. As such, I will not be able to recreate these charts from the original source data, but I plan on changing the format/presentation of them to better communicate my story. 
    
    For example, the following visualization is located on page 11 of [The Bridgespan Group's Racial Equity and Philanthropy Report](https://www.bridgespan.org/bridgespan/Images/articles/racial-equity-and-philanthropy/racial-equity-and-philanthropy.pdf).

    The data used to create this viz is partially the Echoing Green data, but also partially a large data set of organizational 990s that I do not have the capability of collecting. As such, I plan on re-creating/re-designing the surface level information comunicated via this visualizaton to strengthen the arguments of the core visualizations from my Echoing Green data set that will anchor each outline point.

## Method and Medium
I plan on using Tableau to create the dynamic and interactive visualizations from the Echoing Green data set, Canva to redsign the static visualizations found in the reports discussed above, and Shorthand to host and present the final project.
