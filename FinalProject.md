# Final Project: Racial Inequities in Philanthropy

## Part 1
### Outline
#### User/Audience Considerations
**Intended User/Audience:** Nonprofit Development Leaders; Foundation Leaders


**User Story**
* *As a reader, I want* **(an easy way to understand the severity of the issue)** *so that I can* **(persuade key stakeholders to make meaningful change quickly)**
* *I can do this by* **(emphasizing the severity and providing actionable solutions as a follow-up to the problem)**

**What are some ways this project can visualize elements of the user story?**
* Illustrate gaps and trends to show the severity and historical implications of the problem
* Guide the reader to a call to action that fits their specific circumstance


#### Story Outline
**Summary/Thesis:** A significant way in which systemic racism manifests in the nonprofit sector is in the exclusion and “othering” of Black fundraisers and Black led organizations (BLOs) in the fundraising process. This barrier to resources makes it much harder for BLOs to do the necessary work to protect communities that are facing the symptoms of systemic racism themselves, and thus it is the responsibility of the significantly white Development and Foundation sector to understand, address, and resolve this issue.

 1. Overview of nonprofit sector and the role of contributed income
    * a.	Size of sector (# of registered nonprofits in US) in 2016 
    * b.	Total nonprofit Contributed income for 2016 (396.52 billion)<sup>1</sup>
    * c.	Total giving to nonprofits in 2019 ($449.64 billion)<sup>2</sup>
    
    
 2. Lack of funding: not a new issue, but publicly accessible data is hard to find. Echoing Green applicant data provides the largest, most recent, publicly available dataset<sup>3</sup>
    * a.	DATA VIZ (1): 2 Line charts, showing year over year
    * b.	Total Raised by Race/Ethnicity
    * c.	Total % of Applicants by Race/Ethnicity
    
    
 3. Black Fundraisers receive less than their white counterparts, despite being a significantly larger proportion of the applicant pool
    * a.	DATA VIZ (2): Data Viz Project #2: [Nonprofit Fundraising Dollars Awarded by Race/Ethnicity](FundraisingData.md)
    
    
 4. Not just individuals: Ethnic Minority Serving organizations (no Black delineation in data) receive less too
    * a.	DATA VIZ (3): PROGRAM AREA: Ethnic Minority Serving Organizations
    * b.	Significant proportion of Black population under poverty line<sup>4</sup>  
      * i.	Extend above viz to add in Economically Disadvantaged program area: DATA VIZ (4)
      
 5. Recent Increase in Awareness
    * a. Accessible data 
    * b. Increase in reports<sup>5</sup>
    * CCF 10 principles<sup>6</sup>
    
 6. Call to Action
 * a. Foundation Leaders: [Trust Based Philanthropy Project](https://trustbasedphilanthropy.org/)<sup>7</sup>

### The Data
 1. Echoing Green Data Set
    * The main data set I will be using for the above sketched visualizations is the collection of data on Echoing Green's Fellowship Program applicants. This is one of the largest collections of data on social enterprise applicants (download data set [here](Echoing-Green-SSE2-2020-Dataset.xlsx)). The visualizations from this data set will serve as the core/achoring visualizations for outline points 2-4.

 2. Various Reports (see Footnote 5 in Outline Reference section)
    * Due to the inaccessibility of large data sets on these issues (the few that exist other than Echoing Green are all behind paywalls), I will also be using visualizations found in the many reports written by institutions who have accessed and analyzed this paywall-blocked data. As such, I will not be able to recreate these charts from the original source data, but I plan on changing the format/presentation of them to better communicate my story. For example, the following visualization is located on page 11 of [The Bridgespan Group's Racial Equity and Philanthropy Report](https://www.bridgespan.org/bridgespan/Images/articles/racial-equity-and-philanthropy/racial-equity-and-philanthropy.pdf).

    The data used to create this viz is partially the Echoing Green data, but also partially a large data set of organizational 990s that I do not have the capability of collecting. As such, I plan on re-creating/re-designing the surface level information comunicated via this visualizaton to strengthen the arguments of the core visualizations from my Echoing Green data set that will anchor each outline point.

### Method and Medium
I plan on using Tableau to create the dynamic and interactive visualizations from the Echoing Green data set, Canva to redsign the static visualizations found in the reports discussed above, and Shorthand to host and present the final project.

## User Research

### Target Audience and Identification Method
**Target Audience:** Nonprofit Development Leaders; Foundation Leaders

** Representative Interviewees:** I asked the director of advancement at the Mattress Factory (my current internship) to take a look at it, as she is currently a nonprofit development leader and a former foundation leader. I also asked my manager at Mattress Factory, who is a current nonprofit development leader. I also reached out to past classmates who work in foundations. Lastly, I asked for feedback from fellow Master of Arts Management students, many of which also have development internships and experience.

### Interview Script and Selection of Relevant Answers
Interview Script: I used a Google Forms survey that I sent to my interviewees so that they could answer on their own time, and without the pressure of me hovering and waiting for an answer. The following is a breakdown of the questions and the structure of the form. You can view the Google Form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsrPtgBv_y_HLlOOtkNREZOXHzYeJYDzobQcscNb9bzmgCtA/viewform?usp=sf_link) or read the general script below.


 1. Feedback Guidelines
 Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project! Your feedback will be very useful as I fine-tune moving forward.
 To begin, please visit https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/racial-inequities-in-nonprofit-fundraising/index.html and scroll through the web page narrative. Please note that this is a basic "wireframe" outline and therefore is not complete. Additional narrative text will provide additional points on the severity of the issue and related developments.
 In the questions below, I am seeking simple feedback on the effectiveness of the visualizations, as well as the flow of the story overall. The following questions are built with the goal of collecting your impressions on these elements of the story so that I can better craft them into a fully-fledged, published, data-focused narrative. 
 For ease of reference, I have attached thumbnail photos of each visualization for which I am seeking feedback. When providing feedback, please refer to the actual visualizations that are located within the published story outline rather than the thumbnails attached to the survey questions.
 Thank you again and I look forward to your feedback!

 2. The Visualizations
 In this section, I am seeking feedback on the visualizations themselves. In the next section I will ask you about the story overall.
 For ease of reference, I have attached thumbnail photos of each visualization for which I am seeking feedback. When providing feedback, please refer to the actual visualizations that are located within the published story outline rather than the thumbnails attached to the survey questions.
 In this section, I based much of my questions off of the method we used for the critique by redesign assignment. I asked the following questions of each of my 4 visualizations:
 
  Question 1, 5, 9, 13- Visualization X: Intuitiveness. To what degree do you feel like you understand the concept behind the visualization?
   (Understand Little) 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 (Understand completely)
   
  Question 2, 6, 10, 14- Visualization X: Relevance. To what degree does this visualization feel relevant to the surrounding text and topics discussed?
   (Not relevant) 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 (Very relevant)
   
  Question 3, 7, 11, 15- Visualization X: Completeness. Does the visualization have everything it needs to be useful/communicate valuable information?
   (Incomplete) 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 (Complete)
  
  Question 4, 8, 12, 16- Do you have any recommendations that might improve the above visualization?


 3. The Story and Flow
 In this final section, I ask only a few questions on the overarching story and cohesiveness of the narrative.
 
  Question 17- What are your thoughts on the flow of the narrative: how we got from point A to point B, etc? Would you recommend any changes in the order?
  
  Question 18- By the time you reach the Call to Action at the end, how motivated did you feel to take advantage of the resources provided?
   (Not motivated) 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 (Complete)
   
  Question 19- Does the Call to Action feel like appropriate responses to the content of the story?
   Yes / No
   If no, why? Do you have any suggestions?
   
   Question 20- Do you have any thoughts or suggestions about design elements such as colors, fonts, etc (Note that these elements are not finalized as this is still a rough draft/outline, but I do welcome any thoughts if you have them)?
   
   Question 21- Any final thoughts or feedback that you'd like to share?
