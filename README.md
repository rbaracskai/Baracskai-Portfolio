This is where I will be keeping the visualizations I create for my class, Telling Stories with Data, at Carnegie Mellon University

# About Me
My name is Riley Baracskai (buh-RASS-key) and I use he/him pronouns. I am a second year Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of information systems, public policy, and management. I attended SUNY Fredonia from 2015 to 2019, during which time I worked as a ticket office manager, director, and stage manager, graduating summa cum laude in 2019 with a B.A. in Theatre Arts and Arts Administration. I have worked with a wide range of arts institutions, serving as Adult Education Programming Intern at Interlochen Center for the Arts, Development Intern at Pittsburgh’s Quantum Theatre, and currently, Development Intern at Pittsburgh’s Mattress Factory Museum, a nationally and internationally recognized leader in site-specific, contemporary art. 

Particularly interested in how Development/Fundraising departments influence nonprofits and their day-to-day operations, my current research involves exploring alternative fundraising models that make both the Development profession and entire nonprofit sector more diverse, equitable, and inclusive.

Upon graduation, I seek to work with arts institutions that leverage the educational power of the arts to fight for justice, promote equality for all, and bring communities to mutual understanding.

# What I Hope to Learn
I am hoping to hone my skills on color pairings and theory, learn data visualization software, and importantly, learn when to say "no" in my designs and presentations. I am somewhat of a chronic content-overloader when it comes to creating graphics and presentations, and I hope to use the theory and skills I learn from this course to better streamline my work.
