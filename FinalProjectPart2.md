## User Research

### Target Audience and Identification Method
**Target Audience:** Nonprofit Development Leaders; Foundation Leaders

**Representative Interviewees:** I asked the director of advancement at the Mattress Factory (my current internship) to take a look at it, as she is currently a nonprofit development leader and a former foundation leader. I also asked my manager at Mattress Factory, who is a current nonprofit development leader. I also reached out to past classmates who work in foundations. Lastly, I asked for feedback from fellow Master of Arts Management students, many of which also have development internships and experience.

### Interview Script
For this portion of the assignment, I built out a Google Forms survey that I sent to my interviewees so that they could answer on their own time, and without the pressure of me hovering and waiting for an answer. Because of the number of questions in the survey (22 in total), I have linked the Google Form for ease of review. You can view the Google Form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsrPtgBv_y_HLlOOtkNREZOXHzYeJYDzobQcscNb9bzmgCtA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

### Findings From Interviews and Relevant User Quotes
* Visualization #3 (Total giving in 2017) was the fan favorite; everyone felt that it was very effective in communicating the point
  * User Quote: *“I think this one might be my favorite! Contrasting proportions in this way is very effective. If there is a way to make it slightly larger in Shorthand though, it might be easier to read and understand at first glance.”*
  
* Visualization #4 (Organizations Serving Black Men) needs some work. The title doesn’t serve to contextualize the data very well, and some people were just generally confused about what its main point was. Some people thought the white led orgs had 100% unrestricted budgets, rather than showing the disparate proportion like I meant.
  * User Quote: *“The visualization looks great and I can see a clear difference between orgs with white and Black leaders, I just needed some text to clarify the argument surrounding the total unrestricted assets number. I might add a sentence or two in your own words to supplement the quote and visualization. I was also confused about the title - is this visualization comparing orgs with white vs. Black leaders, but only orgs that serve Black men? Or is this data from all types of nonprofits?”*

* People generally liked the flow and sequence of data and arguments, but a few people recommended that FIRST establishing the general lack of funding (viz 3) and proportionately smaller unrestricted assets Black serving organizations have (vz 4) would help make the Echoing Green data (viz 1 and 2) hit harder later.
  * User Quote: *“I might start with the data around smaller operating budgets and total unrestricted assets with lack of philanthropic investment as the problem. Then move to visualizations around funding inequalities.”*

* A common critique was to pare down on the colors in both Viz 1 and in the shorthand website itself, especially when including hyperlinks.
  * User Quote *“Just because every bar is colored, it takes a few seconds to know where to focus. I wonder if there's a way to call out the major difference in the two orange bars.”*
  * User Quote: *"I like the colors but there are kind of a lot of them, it may be helpful to remove one or two."*

* Everyone felt that the call to action was relevant, and enjoyed how I broke it down based on the reader type.

### Planned Changes
* I am first going to try rearranging my story flow: I will start with what is currently Viz 3 to establish the fact that the general funding landscape is scarce for Black people, and then I will move into the specific statistics.
 
* In what is currently Viz 1, I will grey out all of the bars aside from the White and Black race/ethnicity groups. I will also better distinguish the column titles
 
* I need to rework what is currently Viz 4 in general. I’m thinking of keeping the animation, but making it a stacked bar chart instead of a normal bar chart to show that it is a comparison of proportions rather than of values themselves. I also need to rethink the title as well as the context of the text around it to best prepare the reader to get the most out of it.
 
* I will be paring down on the colors in the shorthand website itself, and making sure hyperlinks are visible
 
* I will be sprucing up the Call to Action section a little bit to make it look more engaging. Perhaps making the hyperlinks buttons instead?
