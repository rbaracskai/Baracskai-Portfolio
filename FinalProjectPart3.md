## Part 1 and 2
You can view the process by which this final deliverable came to fruition by reviewing Part 1 and Part 2 of the creation phase via the links below.

## Part 3
I am happy to say that after the user feedback from Part II, I was successfully able to incorporate most of the major points of feedback into my final version for Part III. In this section, I will discuss the project in the context of my original outline, **noting additions in the outline with italics, deletions with strikethrough text, and providing comments on each section below it.**

### Part I Outline with *additions,* ~~deletions~~ and section comments below

 * **1: Overview of nonprofit sector ~~and the role of contributed income~~**
   - ~~Size of sector (# of registered nonprofits in US) in 2016~~
   - ~~Total nonprofit Contributed income for 2016 (396.52 billion)~~
   - ~~Total giving to nonprofits in 2019 ($449.64 billion)~~

After User Research, I decided to remove most of the above section from my outline entirely. My target audience is people who already work in the foundation and nonprofit sector, and are therefore already relatively familiar with its function and size. Instead, I began with an overview of the problem as it relates to the nonprofit sector in a way that those working within it would understand.


 * ***2: Little dedicated funding for Black people***
    - *2017 funding: of all funding in US, only 1.8% went to African American populations*
    - *Black people make up over 13% of the population*
 
I added this new piece of data to show what the general giving sector looked like for Black people. This viz was definitely the favorite in all of the user research, but it was originally the 3rd visualization for Part II. Users found it very impactful, and suggested that it could be a good inital viz to show the general state of the sector before diving in to the detais, so I moved it to the beginning of the body instead of towards the end.


 * **~~2:~~ *4:* Lack of funding: not a new issue, but publicly accessible data is hard to find. Echoing Green applicant data provides the largest, most recent, publicly available dataset**
    - 2 Line charts, showing year over year
    - Black Fundraisers receive less than their white counterparts, despite being a significantly larger proportion of the applicant pool
    - Data Viz Project #2: Nonprofit Fundraising Dollars Awarded by Race/Ethnicity
 
Instead of being the first two data points, as originally had them in my Part II wireframe, I decided that these specific numbers would do better as the last two data points at the end of the story, right before the call to action. Their specificity and dramatic gaps lend well to the “peak” (or in the case of my Part I Story Arc, the deepest “pit”) of the story before covering recent developments and the call to action.

 * **~~4:~~ *3:* Not just individuals: ~~Ethnic Minority Serving organizations (no Black delineation in data) receive less too~~ *Leaders of color experience unique barriers to leading their black-serving organizations***
    - PROGRAM AREA: ~~Ethnic Minority~~ *Black* Serving Organizations
    - ~~Significant proportion of Black population under poverty line~~
    - ~~Extend above viz to add in Economically Disadvantaged program area~~
 
I had to completely rethink how I wanted to communicate this point, as the large scale data set was not helping me make it in the way that I wanted to. That’s when I turned to my initial problem child, the bar chart viz below.

INSERT THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM CHART

This viz was the source of most of my critique in Part II. The bar graph nature of the viz rightfully made viewers think that it was a measure of value rather than a comparison of proportions, and were left wanting the actual numbers (which I didn’t have, as this viz is a recreation of a statistic from a report). The title also didn’t aid in understanding that the sample being described was of a subset of all organizations. This ran counter to my point, as I was trying to show how much harder it is to secure funding for Black leaders and Leaders of Color in organizations that seek to help the lives of Black men. I considered turning it into a stacked bar chart, but in-class feedback made me realize I would run into the same problems with this format too.
Another problem I found on my own with this viz is that I accidentally inaccurately represented the statistic. In the accurate “total unrestricted assets” statistic, the sample compared to "organizations with white leaders” is “organizations with leaders who are people of color” not “organizations with leaders who are black”. I made adjustments to account for all of these issues in the following redesign:

INSERT THE NEW VERSION

In this new version, I completely rethought the format, as well as fixed the content errors. The new version was instantly more clear. Using icons instead of bars eliminated the convention and expectation of measurement, and it made clear that I was simply comparing one thing to another. The refined title and additional subtitle helped me clarify the subset-nature of the visualization. The caps remained shocking, and the concept became clearer. I was very happy with this redesign, and thankful for the feedback I received on it in all of its forms.

 * **5: Recent Increase in Awareness
   - Accessible data
   - Increase in reports
   - ~~CCF 10 principles~~

I used this time to talk a little more about how none of these issues are new, it's just that we're hearing more about them now. I aldo removed the discussion of CCF's 10 principles because a) there was no way to summarize them well and b) one of the target audience types will be directed there via the call to action anyway.

 * **6: Call to Action
   - Foundation Leaders: ~~Trust Based Philanthropy Project~~ *Bridgespan Group and AFBE's “Guiding a Giving Response to Anti-Black Injustice.*
   - Nonprofit Development Leaders: Community Centric Fundraising *+ Cause Effective’s, "Money, Power, and Race: The Lived Experiences of Fundraisers of Color."

After reviewing the Trust Based Philanthropy project in more detail, I realized it didn't have as much of a focus on racial justice as it needed to for this piece. I replaced it with something far better and more specific to the story. I also added a "first step" call to action for white nonprofit professionals so that they could first understand the experiences of their Black coworkers/employees/colleagues before jumping in to Community Centric Fundraising.
