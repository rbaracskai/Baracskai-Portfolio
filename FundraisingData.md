I chose this visualization not only because I believe that the data can be visualized better, but also because I believe this data needs to be visualized in a way that accurately depicts the massive problem they represent. While Black fundraisers have been talking about the funding disparities they and their nonprofit organizations have faced for decades, large scale data confirming this truth has only been collected and discussed recently. The fact that it took so long for this data to receive attention is a problem in and of itself, but nevertheless, it exists, and it tells a disturbing story. I chose to redesign this particular table because I believe it fails to capitalize on the emotionally compelling shock of the differences between the figures; we can logically understand that 39.95% and 46.98% are different figures, but when we see those differences compared before us, our emotions become a part of this realization. I believe that this emotional reaction is necessary in order for fundraising leaders and grant providers to understand and work against these historical trends.

## 2. My Redesign Process
I began my process by searching for public data for a fact that I already knew to be true: white fundraisers and organizations are awarded far more in grant dollars than their Black counterparts, despite being a significantly smaller proportion of applicants. I had read this fact in many articles throughout the past year, but it took me a long time to find a publicly available data set with an associated visualization to critique. The inaccessibility of this data in the first place speaks volumes of the problem itself; no one believed the lived experiences of Black fundraisers. While research firms are patting themselves on the back for “discovering” this trend, Black fundraisers continue to put in more work for less results.


I eventually found a data set of the last 4 years of Echoing Green’s grant applicants, which has been cited in many articles and reports, and then I took to critiquing the visualization itself. The biggest problem for me is that it is represented in a table. As I discussed above, this prevents the viewer from having as strong of an emotional reaction when they actually see the difference in the figures. This is a problem that needs immediate attention from those in the industry. Unfortunately, these people often have limited time. While a table is good for showing multiple dimensions of data, some of the data included in the table is not necessary to create the desired reaction. 


Based on these observations, I moved on to the wireframing process using Balsamiq. I tossed around the idea of a stacked bar, but that only felt appropriate for the breakdown of the proportion of applicants. While the total number of applicants matters, the total number of funds raised does not; only the fact that white fundraisers make far more than anyone else. This led me to a series of bar charts. At first I was worried that two bar charts was too basic, so I tried incorporating a stacked-bar approach to the x axis (Race/Ethnicity) so that the width of the bars corresponded to the total percentage of applicants. My user feedback revealed that not only was it conusing that the x axis was supposed to represent 100% of another variable, but once that obstacle was overcome, the width of the Black fundraisers bar made the towering white fundraisers bar seem less stark.


Remembering what the textbook said about the classic methods being classic because they work, I dove into redesigning the data as a pair of bar charts: one showing the dollars raised by fundraisers of different races/ethnicities, and one showing what proportion each racial/ethnic group made of the total applicant pool. This is when I ran into trouble with the data itself. I realized that the visualization I had critiqued was on **United States** fundraisers, but geographic data was not included in the Race and Ethnicity sheet I was using for analysis. After trying half a dozen ways of cross referencing this sheet with another sheet containing the geographic data, I moved on. 


I made a few significant changes to the data analyzed beyond the format itself. I removed the “median funds” variable from my analysis as I didn’t feel that it added much and took far more time to understand than was worth for the desired effect. In order to match the racial/ethnic groups listed on the original visualization, I excluded entries that reported “other” and “prefer not to say” when reporting their race/ethnicity. I also chose to display the full dollar amounts that each group raised, rather than a percentage, as I felt that the percentages obscured the significance of the disparity.


It turns out that the global data is even more disparate than the United States data, which better serves to tell the story I was hoping to tell. While I am not thankful that it is true, the global data confirms an even more dramatic fact: African-America, African, and Black fundraisers *world wide* are not being awarded the same amount of funds as their White counterparts, despite being a significantly larger portion of the total applicants. My hope is for both fundraisers writing grant applications and grant providers themselves see this data, understand the severity of this inequity, and do the work necessary to fix it.
