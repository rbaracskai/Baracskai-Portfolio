Both of the following charts describe and contextualize various international **Debt-to-GDP ratios.** These ratios express **the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP.** 

This ratio is a key indicator of governmental financial sustainability; a low ratio indicates high capacity to pay back debts without incurring more debt.

### Linear General Government Debt, Last 25 Years
Alphabetically organized by country code, the chart below compares year-to-year trends for each country's debt-to-GDP ratio.

## ReDesign #2
### Debt Distribution in Consistent Reporters
The chart below is comprised of a subset of data from the above sample in which only the countries that reported data for each year between 2000 and 2018 are analyzed.

## Discussion
While the original OECD Chart is a good way of understanding the debt-to-GDP ratios as they compare to each other for one specific year, it does not give much context for the ebbs and flows of this financial measure on its own. ReDesign #1 addresses this concern by providing a comprehensive, linear display in which the viewer can easily compare year-over-year figures for each country in one place. I chose to display all countries on a 5x7 grid, which results in an even distribution of graphs, resulting in no negative space or "loner" graphs at the end of the collection of graphs. The unavoidable problem with this design is that, because the data has to be split between multiple lines, it is difficult to make a big-picture analysis of all countries together because our eyes find it difficult to compare lines that are not nearby. We can certainly see that JPN, GRC, and ESP end in high ratios, but the massive differences in even these most extreme final figures for these countries is lost on the viewer unless they scroll to the pop-up and compare the actual numerical data.
